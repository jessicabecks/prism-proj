# PRISM™ – Proactive Risk Identification and Systems Management

PRISM is an innovative, data-driven risk management framework developed to modernize how federally funded infrastructure projects in the United States identify, manage, and mitigate risk. Unlike traditional models, PRISM leverages real-time analytics, predictive modeling, and workflow automation to transform risk from a reactive burden into a proactive asset.

## 🚀 Project Overview

Traditional risk frameworks like ISO 31000 and COSO ERM are limited in their ability to handle the complexity, speed, and scale of modern infrastructure projects. PRISM fills these gaps through:

- 🔍 **Proactive Risk Detection**  
- 📊 **Real-Time Dashboards (Power BI)**  
- 🤝 **Stakeholder-Centered Collaboration**  
- 🤖 **Automation with Power Automate**  
- 🧠 **Predictive Modeling and Analytics**

---

## 📐 Methodology Structure

The PRISM Methodology unfolds in four key phases:

### 1. **Baseline Assessment and Needs Analysis**
- Analyze gaps in traditional frameworks using Power BI and stakeholder input.
- Deliverable: Foundational research report with identified pain points and needs.

### 2. **Framework Design and Prototyping**
- Build a modular MVP with predictive models and automated workflows.
- Tools: Power BI, Power Automate, Agile + Scrum.
- Deliverable: Fully functional prototype of the PRISM system.

### 3. **Pilot Testing and Training**
- Deploy MVP on selected federal projects in energy, construction, and transportation.
- Measure KPIs: detection accuracy, cost savings, risk visibility.
- Deliverable: Refined framework based on live performance data.

### 4. **Nationwide Scaling and Continuous Deployment**
- Scale PRISM across states and sectors.
- Tailor deployment kits, monitor real-time metrics, evolve based on policy and need.
- Deliverable: Fully embedded national risk management solution.
