    "Traditional risk management frameworks such as ISO 31000, the COSO Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) model, and PRINCE2 have played significant roles in guiding organizations in risk identification, assessment, and response. For instance, ISO 31000 provides broadly applicable principles, while COSO emphasizes strategic integration of risk into enterprise processes, and PRINCE2 incorporates structured risk control within project management. However, despite their widespread adoption, these frameworks are often limited by their reactive orientation, generic applicability, and lack of real-time data analytics and automation. They tend to rely heavily on historical data, manual risk tracking, and static reporting structures, approaches that are insufficient for managing the dynamic and large-scale complexities of federally funded infrastructure projects in the United States."

    "To overcome these limitations, I have developed an innovative methodology called PRISM (Proactive Risk Identification and Systems Management). PRISM introduces a forward-looking, predictive, and adaptive approach to risk management, specifically tailored to public infrastructure delivery. What sets PRISM apart is its inherent integration of advanced data analytics, cross-functional stakeholder collaboration, workflow automation, and continuous performance improvement, components that work together to enable real-time threat detection and proactive decision-making. By combining established methodologies such as Agile, Waterfall, Lean, and Six Sigma within a modern, digital ecosystem, PRISM not only fills the gaps left by traditional frameworks, but also creates a scalable, policy-aware risk management solution built for the evolving demands of national infrastructure systems."
